# Dolphin

This is a file explorer. Use it to move files/folders between servers, rename files/folders and open the script editor.

## Drag & Drop

Files and folders can be transfered between different servers and folders. Transfering to a different server will copy your files, while transfering on the same server will move your files.  
You can drop files onto the breadcrumbs at the top, onto the server names in the explorer, onto a folder or inside another Dolphin window.
You can also drop files onto your desktop if you are using [Plasma](../plasma/README.md)

## Renaming

Renaming can be done by double clicking on a file/folder name.

## Editing

Press the pen next to a .js or .txt file to edit it.

## Deleting

Press the thrash can next to a file/folder to delete it. You will be asked for confirmation by a pop up!

## Starting a script

Double clicking a script will start it on the server it is located. It will be started without arguments, to start a script with arguments the terminal is still needed.

## Coding Contracts

The Coding Contracts tab will show all coding contracts on the network as if they are in the same folder. This is mainly useful to check if any contracts exist at all, there isnt any real features to interact with them yet.
